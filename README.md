**OMORI Console+ development has been stopped indefinitely.**

Due to the never ever-ending toxicity and snitching in the modding community, It has been making my mental health decline, and thus, I quit.

You can still download the mod from mods.one, but if you see any bug, or glitch, or whatever, or if it doesn't work for some god for saken reason, **i will not help you.**

This was a hobby project for me, not a discord drama simulator middle school edition. It doesn't make sense to continue working on a hobby which isn't fun anymore.

I also want to mention the fact that **I almost lost the final version of OMORI Console+**, which could be the early end of Console+, It didn't. I started to wonder, what is the point of me trying to recover this god forsaken mod, if everyone is going to throw out non-civil-contructive critism? It didn't matter. 

Thanks to everyone who wasn't a dick in the OMORI community.

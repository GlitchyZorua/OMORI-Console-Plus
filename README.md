**OMORI Console+ development has been stopped indefinitely.**

Due to the never ever-ending toxicity and snitching in the modding community, It has been making my mental health decline, and thus, I quit.

You can still download the mod from mods.one, but if you see any bug, or glitch, or whatever, or if it doesn't work for some god for saken reason, **i will not help you.**

This was a hobby project for me, not a discord drama simulator middle school edition. It doesn't make sense to continue working on a hobby which isn't fun anymore.

I also want to mention the fact that **I almost lost the final version of OMORI Console+**, which could be the early end of Console+, It didn't. I started to wonder, what is the point of me trying to recover this god forsaken mod, if everyone is going to throw out non-civil-contructive critism? It didn't matter. 

Thanks to everyone who wasn't a dick in the OMORI community.


Edit from 2024: Also, to you, kenway, this is a special message for you. If you didn't get involved in the drama, and would let the mods handle it, I wouldn't be so angry at you. You poked the fucking bear. What I said wasn't nice, yeah, but sometimes there are times where I don't realize what i said could be hurtful. You didn't need to get involved in conversations. It is not your goddamn job to call someone out for something that they didn't realize what they said. Even if you had a good point, Why should I listen to someone that I hate? let alone hates me? You just saw an oppartunity to *get* rid of me all because you were milking a joke that literally got you warned again, and again, and again, and even tried to use an alt to poke the bear even more. You never learn from your mistakes. Stop it. Get some help. 

You only appealed because *you are not sorry*, you just wanted to be unbanned. you simply do not care.

I will not forget about that one hateful email that you sent me.
